  </div>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>In today’s post, I plan on taking you on an adventure through the process of assembling a robotic arm. Be ready to gain an understanding into the mechanics, hear fun tales, and maybe even discover some unexpected lessons about the bond between generations. I have been interested in robotics for as long as I can remember. I wanted to learn the know-how to work with robots, but I did not know where to start. My parents bridged that gap for me, and I hope to do the same for you.
<p>For a few years before this project, I had owned a mechanics kit with which I had built multiple small trucks and a somewhat whimsical helicopter. That was the closest I had ever come to undertaking a building project. But this might have helped me gain commendable experience when it came to assembly. Typically, every summer I managed to keep myself occupied with various crafts. But that summer, the usual antics I engaged in did not seem as fun anymore. I began searching for something that could spark my interest again. One of my math teachers at school has a knack for trigonometry. Whenever she answers our doubts relating to trigonometry, or whenever the topic bumps up during calculus, there is a kind of glint in her eyes. I wanted to find something which would do the same for me. Consequently, my dad ordered a robotic arm kit.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the kit, a sense of anticipation and excitement filled the air. As we opened the kit, in a sense I also felt overwhelmed by the fact that all these components would combine to form a fully functioning robot. Looking at the manual definitely helped provide reassurance that things would fit in together. It was decided then, that my first project would be a robotic arm. All that’s left is to dive into it!</p>
<p>What was this project exactly?</p>
<p>Think of a robot that can act just like your arm. It can pick up things, move them around, and even twist and turn just like you do. But what’s really cool about it is that you do not need to be a computer genius to make it work. It involves zero soldering and coding. Essentially, it proved to be the ideal project for someone like me who was just starting out.</p>
<p>Now that you are familiar with the gist of the project, let us delve a bit more into the mechanic side. Let's break it down:</p>
<p>Control: You can control the arm using the switches on the remote control. It is as easy as playing a video game. It has 3 lever-like switches from which you can move around the 3 joints present in the robot.</p>
<p>Movements: This arm can move as following:
- It can swing its wrist about 120 degrees.
- The elbow can bend and straighten up to 300 degrees.
- The base can spin around left or right for 270 degrees.
- It can also move forward and backward a total of 180 degrees.</p>

<p>Reach and Lifting: The arm can reach up to 15 inches high. Plus, it is strong enough to lift things as heavy as a small hamster on a diet, up to 100 grams! So, if you ever need a hand with your hamster's weightlifting routine, we have got you covered.</p>

<p>Safety Features: The gripper has a searchlight on it. There's also a sound feature that lets you know if something is going wrong with the gears to keep everything safe.</p>

<p>This arm's secret lies in its joints and gears. It has three joints that are like its muscles and bones. They work together making it move smoothly. The shoulder joint holds the arm steady, the elbow joint bends and stretches, and the wrist joint makes it twist. These joints allow it to do all sorts of things, like picking up and moving stuff (like dieting hamsters).</p>
<p>So, with some simple controls, joints, and gears, our robotic arm is ready to take on all sorts of tasks.</p>
<p>Another exciting aspect for me was being able to share this experience with my grandpa. I remember sitting for 2 days at a stretch on our dining table trying to thorough the assembly process. He was just as excited as I was. My grandpa is an electrical engineer by degree, and has always been the person we have counted on for getting things done systematically. I feel that to be able to learn something new, having supportive people around you is always something that will push you forward by bounds.</p>

<p>The last step of the build was the connection of wires. This connection was unknown territory to me, and on top of it all, we had managed to lose the pages of the manual that explained these connections. The majority of the second day was spent trying to perfect the wire connections. After four trials –take or leave 2– we managed to achieve the desired product. But once the wires were connected, they seemed like they were all over the place so we had to tape them together. All in all, at the end we were able to make our fully functioning robotic arm. Creating new things is a joy I want all of you to feel. It is not just this feeling of seeing your creation take shape and feel accomplished, but also the messy and wonderful process itself. It helps you find out things about yourself that you might have previously been blind to.</p>
<p>For all of you who have a strong interest in robotics but are unsure of how to take your step forward, embrace opportunities of learning with your loved ones. 
Thank you!</p>
